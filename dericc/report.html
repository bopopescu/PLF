	<h2><b>Introduction and Design/Development</b></h2>
<a><p>From the start, our overarching design concept was for a static left search bar, combined with links for submissions and personal items, and a dynamic panel of item listings on the right. We drew this general design concept from the site Rentenna.com, where one of our members had interned over the summer. Through preliminary design pitches to our peers, we received positive feedback on our overall concept, so we decided to stick with our initial plan. Though we experienced major design changes in terms of web tools and templates throughout the course of our project, our core design configuration remained the same.</p>

<p>We began by using a simple Django template/HTML setup, and started our project implementing a basic search bar and a simple Django-generated form to allow us to submit items to our database. Next, we filled out the core design features by creating fixed submission buttons and a search bar on the left, and a permanent title bar for design features, such as the "show all", "lost", and "found" filters, as well as a persistent login/logout button on the top right. Around the same time, we implemented the CAS login/logout system on the local host, creating two different views for the website: though you could view and search listings while logged out, you were prevented from submitting or claiming listings.</p>

<p>Finally, we developed proper "boxes" for item listings with corresponding pictures to fit on the right portion of our website, and we used the Isotope jQuery plugin to animate these boxes dynamically. This was our most basic "core" implementation.</p>

<p>We shifted our focus to adding additional features after completing the core functionality of our website. First up, however, was a complete redesign: we switched to using Bootstrap by the suggestion of fellow COS sophomore Bobby Ullman, which required us to essentially re-implement all of our CSS. Though it took a good amount of work, the visual and practical benefits of switching to Bootstrap were certainly worth it: the site became much cleaner and more dynamic, responding to mouseovers and "accordion-style" search and submission tabs. While Matt and Reed were redesigning our entire CSS presentation, Sam and Deric developed our user-friendly features. They created the advanced search tab, designed a "My Items" page to keep track of personal unresolved listings, and implemented our intelligent search, which consisted of mapping locations to similar places based on proximity, common misspellings, and colloquialisms. We finished up our additional functionality by creating a "suggested matches" feature, recommending listings that appeared to be highly similar to those submitted by the user.</p>
	
<p>In the final three to four days, we focused primarily on streamlining our website and creating an intuitive, simple application with excellent presentation. First, we consolidated the entire website into one page by converting redirections into modal views, dimming the rest of the page for entries such as the item submission form and confirmations. This actually vastly improved our UI; submissions went from taking over a minute to approximately 20-30 seconds for a normal item listing, saving us a couple of page reloads. Next, we normalized Isotope listing widths and maximum picture size, creating a clean design that spans three columns on the average laptop browser but resizes quickly and pleasantly when the browser width is changed. Finally, we spent about a day perfecting minor design elements: we changed mouseover and focus colors from blue to a light orange, adding a tasteful but subtle Princeton palate to our TigerApp. We experimented with fonts and styles to find the best blend of readability and modern design; we also tried adding differing background colors to item listings to visually indicate "lost" and "found" items, but we found these colors to be both distracting and rather unattractive (orange, as we've found, does not go well with anything--even more orange). </p></a>
<h2><b>Surprises</b></h2>
<a><p>There were many pleasant surprises. We discovered that jQuery is an awesome tool for handling JSON requests, manipulating document elements with selectors, and more. HTML5 widgets look really nice, and can be imported into Django forms easily. Bootstrap makes handsome website design a snap; the generic design was an issue, but we made sure to spend time personalizing it. OIT was very helpful and made it easy for us to get our website quickly verified to use CAS redirects. We were able to consolidate our website to one core home page, which was a much simpler and more intuitive design than we had initially expected to achieve. And Wesley Cao, a webmaster of the USG, was ready to help us transition to full deployment on TigerApps. Another student, Jeremy, had designed a website to fulfill a similar role; however, he decided he liked our website and gave us the go-ahead to put it up on TigerApps.</p>
 
<p>Expectedly, there were unpleasant surprises as well. Some of our nice HTML5 widgets (specifically the date widget) don't work in some browsers, such as Firefox. We made heavy use of modals for the experience of our website, and they were tricky to work with, often behaving in really unexpected ways-where you defined the modal in the HTML file mattered in terms of its behavior relative to other modals. The lack of resources online for modals was also a problem, and it took us a while to get them to layer on top of each other in the way we wanted. For our database, we intended to use South to help migrate our database whenever we made changes to the Django models, so we wouldn't have to drop the database every time we wanted to make a change. However, this never really worked as planned, and we often had to drop the database anyway. Finally, we used the Github app to manage our project repository, and it was a little painful to work with, especially when conflicts arose. The repository even went down during a critical time (the day before our presentation), so we were unable to sync during that time.</p></a>
<h2><b>If we had more time?</b></h2>
<a><p>If there were more time, there are a few things we'd like to focus on. We'd like to work more on image resizing: we tried several different approaches-such as getting the image temporary path from the request files and running the UNIX convert command on it through the operating system's command line, downloading python and django libraries to modify the model representation in the database, using the python image libraries, and so on-but none of them proved successful for us. Having to store full-size images takes unnecessary space, and this would be a nice improvement.</p>

<p>Another improvement we would like to make is a more intelligent search, for regular search, advanced search, and the "suggested matches" on submission. We envision our advanced search having jQuery autocomplete (this would be quick to implement; we just ran out of time), the ability to handle typos, the ability to match similar categories of items (for example, match "sweater" and "cardigan"), and to weight the degree to which items match and display them appropriately (displaying best-match items first). We would also like our search algorithm to determine which keywords are most important (in a description, title, or location), and add more weight to those in the matching process. This would probably involve implementing artificial intelligence and training on a series of inputs.</p>

<p>We would also like to optimize the speed of our website by only displaying 20 or so items at a time; the user would be offered a jQuery-enabled "See More" button at the bottom of the division, which they could click. And, given more time, we would of course perform more stress tests, as well. In particular, we would like to have a larger number of real users heavily using our system simultaneously. We were able to test with real users, but never in any large quantity for an extended period of time.</p></a>
<h2><b>If there were a next time?</b></h2>
<a><p>There weren't any huge missteps we made or major components we scrapped. We would certainly do things differently next time, but the difference would be subtle; we came into this project with none of us knowing any of the frameworks or technologies we ended up using or even having any web design or large-scale programming experience. As such, we learned a lot about working as a team and understanding how to implement a new feature into an existing system. If we were to start a new project from scratch, we would definitely be able to plan every component in more detail (perhaps even with some pseudo-code) instead of being high-level and saying something like, "We'll use Django."</p></a>
<h2><b>What can next year's class learn from us?</b></h2>
<a><p>Start as early as possible on aspects of your project that are close to the system, or low-level-for example, databases can be difficult to set up even on a Linux or a Max, not to mention on a Windows/etc. The documentation or setup help you're looking for can be hard to find, even on stackoverflow, and often it will take a lot of trial-and-error to get things working. Of course, also start early on learning the languages you plan to use but are less familiar with.</p>

<p>In keeping with the trial-and-error theme, keep a log of every challenge, bug, or problem that you faced and how you fixed it. Often another team member will encounter the same problem (or you yourself will), and you'll be making so many changes that it's easy to forget if you don't write it down.</p>

<p>Division of responsibility is a good idea-it sounds intuitive or obvious (and our TA, Chris Moretti, suggested this to us early on), but we started to do this late in the project and it would have been better had we started earlier. What this means is that each person in the group is the "leader" for a particular section of the project, such as managing the database and systems, writing the server-side code, writing the client-side code, etc. In the end, everyone has a part that he wants to see succeed and can explain the technical details of his part to other group members.</p>

<p>If no one in your group has extensive web/phone application development experience, try to find a few friends who are knowledgeable and ask them not for specific coding help, but for their opinions. They might suggest a web toolkit or framework that you hadn't heard of but greatly simplifies your task. For us, this was Bootstrap, which we discovered maybe a week before our beta test was due. We ended up scrapping all the design we had done so far.</p>

<p>Almost everything you want to do has been done in some form already. For us, often a combination of researching as much as possible and trying to glue things together was the fastest or best solution. It is also a good way to learn languages.</p>	

<p>Best of luck! This was a great learning experience for us.</p>
