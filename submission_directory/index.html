<p> We've all taken a foray on a chilly winter night to Charter Fridays, hoping to find a exciting party, only to realize
	that somebody 'accidentally' picked up your black North Face jacket on the way out. What do you do? There's a 
	Princeton Lost and Found Facebook group; however, it's currently at 1,700 members and sends out ~5 spam posts a day. 
	List-servs are a mess; nobody ever checks e-mails that have the title "LOST: black North Face". 
</p>
<p>
	We're proposing Princeton Lost and Found, an elegant, simple website that allows you to search, submit, and sort your
	listings from a single home page. It features dynamically reordering listings, anonymous postings using the Princeton 
	CAS Login system, and support for "My Items", which you can keep track of through a permanent sidebar. A unique feature
	of our PLF website is our implementation of intelligent search: given any location on campus, searching for a building 
	or area will return all common misspellings, colloquialisms, and nearby buildings. Furthermore, you can search for
	items lost within a specific amount of time or sub-matches of a description. Another feature we've added is recommended
	matches: if you submit something that seems remarkably similar to an item in our database, we'll suggest it to you
	as potentially your lost/found item. As a final bonus, it comes with Princeton-trademarked orange mouseovers and 
	blur effects, for the classic Princeton experience.
