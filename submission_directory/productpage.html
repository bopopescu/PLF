<p><b>There is definite interest in a Lost and Found system for Princeton, as indicated by the Princeton Lost & Found Facebook group (which has upwards of 1600 members, and is updated almost daily). However, a generalized Facebook system clearly has a number of flaws: there is no feasible way to filter the results by "lost" or "found," by type of item, by location, and more. Systematic search is not an option. The presentation is also lacking, because a user must scroll through a list of dense and often irrelevant text entries in order to find what they're looking for.</b></p>

<p><b>Our system is a specialized solution to this problem. We created an attractive user interface and TigerApp that greatly simplifies the task of searching for a lost item or posting a found item. Our system would allows a user to remain anonymous until a match between lost and found items is made by using CAS authentication, to encourage a higher rate of returns and also protect user identity. We hope that, as a result, more students in general will be encouraged to use our system and thus more lost items will be returned to their owners.</b></p>

<p><b>Thank you for your support!</b></p>
