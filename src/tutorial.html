		<p style="font-size:20px;"><strong>Homepage</strong><p>
		<p>Here's the home page, and also the only page, of Princeton Lost and Found. On the top, you can see a permanent navigation bar: this bar provides
login/logout functionality, and the ability to sort by lost and found
items.
On the left, we have a permanent utility bar: you can dynamically
search for listings by entering any search terms in the "Search" bar
and pressing Enter. We also have access to the Advanced Search, My
Items, and Submission tabs.
Finally, we've got our item listings neatly ordered on the right,
from newest to oldest submissions. Claim an item by clicking the
"This is Mine" or "I Found This" buttons!</p>

		<p style="font-size:20px;"><strong>Lost</strong></p>
		<p>You can dynamically sort the listings by clicking on the "show all",
"lost", and "found" buttons on the permanent top bar. This sorting is
achieved through Isotope's library, and is a nice little animated
touch for the user. Click on the "Lost" button to see lost items.</p>

		<p>You can also sort to see only the found items, by clicking the Found
button. Congratulations! You're a pro button clicker!</p>

		<p style="font-size:20px;"><strong>My Items</strong></p>
		<p>On the left, you can see the list of items that you currently have
posted as lost or found. Resolving an item means that you've either
found your lost item, or returned a found item. Clicking "Resolved?"
will remove the item from our database.</p>

		<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
		<br>
		<p style="font-size:20px;"><strong>Advanced Search</strong></p>
		<p>Our Advanced Search sorts by all possible sets of information
associated with our listings: Lost/Found, Item name, Category,
Location, Date, and Description. Users can select ranges of dates to
search for their items, from one day to an entire month.</p>

		<p style="font-size:20px;"><strong>Submit</strong></p>
		<p>
If you've lost a treasured item or found something that doesn't belong to you, submit it to Princeton Lost and Found! Clicking on submit will take you to this form. It's pretty intuitive: fill out the available information, and click submit! If your submission seems similar to any items already in our database, we'll pop up a notification with recommended items to check.</p>

		<p>Our About page exists primarily to inform users about our existence
and the hard work that we put into this project. However, we've also
found it important to give users necessary information about the
website itself, such as spam limits and removal times. This page is
our catch-all page for information, copyrights, or updates that would
be added in PLF's future as a TigerApp.</p>
